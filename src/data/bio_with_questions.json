The study of molecular genetics will lay the foundation for students to study further in the field of biotechnology and be aware of its impact on society. The study of biodiversity will help students to recognise its complexity and the adaptations of different groups of organisms to their environment. Moreover, a phylogenetic approach to the classification system is adopted, which helps them to understand the development of the classification system with evidence gathered from molecular genetics. This will enable students to appreciate the phenomena of evolution and develop their curiosity about the origins of life. In addition to Darwin’s theory, students are encouraged to explore other scientific explanations for the origins of life and evolution, to help illustrate the dynamic nature of scientific knowledge.",

                    "overview": "Organisms are an integral part of the environment. Their ways of life and living are closely related to the environment where they live in. Based on this perspective, students will gain knowledge and understanding of organisms and their environment. Firstly, students will study how organisms obtain their basic needs for oxygen, water and food from the environment. Life processes, such as nutrition, gas exchange, and transport involved, will be studied in an integrated manner so as to enhance understanding of the structures and functions of an organism as a whole. Secondly, students will study reproduction, growth and development to understand how organisms perpetuate and proliferate in the environment. The human is used as a model for students to understand the essential life processes of animals. Thirdly, students will examine how organisms detect changes in the environment and make appropriate responses for their survival, and how humans maintain a steady internal environment. Students will then explore how organisms interact with each other and with their environment as a whole. Finally, the dynamic nature of the ecosystems that involves energy flow and materials cycling will also be investigated. Students are expected to develop an awareness of the impact of human activities on the ecosystems and recognise the need for conservation.",

This is designed to help students develop a positive attitude towards health and be aware of both individual and public responsibility for the maintenance of a healthy community. The routes of pathogen transmission and the causes of some non-infectious diseases are to be learned in association with the biological principles that may lead to their prevention and control. The physiological defence mechanisms employed by the human body to combat diseases, the principle of vaccination, the use of antibiotics, and some of the related issues, are also discussed.",

Regulation and control is an interesting topic concerning the intriguing mechanisms which enable our bodies to function normally regardless of the changes in environmental conditions. Students are expected to understand the roles of nervous control and hormonal control in coordinating different organs and systems to achieve a steady internal environment. Human Physiology: Regulation and Control builds on students’ prior knowledge of Movement of substances across membrane, Essential life processes, Coordination and response and Homeostasis studied in the compulsory part.",

Students will explore some of the ways in which human activities can impose far-reaching effects on the environment. Local and global pollution issues, resources management, pollution control measures and conservation will be also discussed. At the end, students are expected to apply a range of field study skills to investigate the impact of pollution on the local environment. Applied Ecology builds on students’ prior knowledge of the Diversity of life forms, Essential life processes, Ecosystems and Health and Diseases studied in the compulsory part.",

In this topic, students will develop an understanding of the diversity of microorganisms, and their beneficial and harmful roles. Students will have the opportunity to study the growth of microorganisms, and develop appropriate laboratory skills and techniques for conducting practical work with microorganisms. Examples of uses of microorganisms in food, medicine, industry pollution control and genetic engineering are included, so as to illustrate the importance of microorganisms and their wide applications. Finally, human diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms, and microbial deterioration are used to illustrate the harmful effects of microorganisms. Microorganisms and Humans builds on students’ prior knowledge of Cellular energetics, Molecular genetics, Diversity of life forms, Functioning of ecosystem, and Diseases studied in the compulsory part.",

This will enable them to recognise biotechnology as a rapidly expanding branch of Biology. Students will first develop an understanding of the principles of different techniques in modern biotechnology, e.g. recombination DNA technology, polymerase chain reaction, genetically modification of organisms, plants and animal cloning. They will also become familiar with the applications of biotechnology in the area of medicine and agriculture, and be aware of the ethical, legal, social, economic and environmental implications of biotechnology. Current issues, research and developments in biotechnology, as well as the contribution of biotechnology to the advancement of biology will also be discussed. Biotechnology builds on students’ prior knowledge of Cells and Molecules of Life; Molecular genetics; Reproduction, growth and development; Ecosystems and Diseases studied in the compulsory part.",
